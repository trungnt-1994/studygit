 -n|--no-act   Only print the commands, no action (implies -v)
 -s|--size     NUMBER - Size of the medium (default: 4488M)
 -m|--move     Move files to target dirs (default: create mkisofs catalogs)
 -l|--symlink  similar to -m but just creates symlinks in the target dirs
 -L|--hardlink like -l but creates hardlinks
 -p|--prefix   STRING - first part of catalog/directory name (default: vol_)
 -f|--filter   EXPR - Filter expression, see examples below and perlre manpage
 --flat        Flat dir mode, don't recreate subdirectory structure (not recommended)
 -e|--expmode  NUMBER, special exploration modes, used with directory argument

  1: (default) native exploration of the specified directory, but file sizes
               are rounded up to 2048 blocks plus estimated overhead for
               filenames (see -o option)
  2: like 1, but all files in directory are put together (as "atom") onto the
               same medium. This does not apply to subdirectories, however.
  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration
               mode.
 -a|--accuracy NUMBER (1=faster, large number=better efficiency, default: 500)
 -S|--simple   Simple/stupid/alphabetic mode

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               are rounded up to 2048 blocks plus estimated overhead for
               filenames (see -o option)
  2: like 1, but all files in directory are put together (as "atom") onto the
               same medium. This does not apply to subdirectories, however.
  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration
               mode.
 -a|--accuracy NUMBER (1=faster, large number=better efficiency, default: 500)
 -S|--simple   Simple/stupid/alphabetic mode
 -T|--input    FILENAME (or - for STDIN):  List with sizes and paths, try:

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               are rounded up to 2048 blocks plus estimated overhead for
               filenames (see -o option)
  2: like 1, but all files in directory are put together (as "atom") onto the
               same medium. This does not apply to subdirectories, however.
  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration
               mode.
 -a|--accuracy NUMBER (1=faster, large number=better efficiency, default: 500)
 -S|--simple   Simple/stupid/alphabetic mode
 -T|--input    FILENAME (or - for STDIN):  List with sizes and paths, try:

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               are rounded up to 2048 blocks plus estimated overhead for
               filenames (see -o option)
  2: like 1, but all files in directory are put together (as "atom") onto the
               same medium. This does not apply to subdirectories, however.
  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration
               mode.
 -a|--accuracy NUMBER (1=faster, large number=better efficiency, default: 500)
 -S|--simple   Simple/stupid/alphabetic mode
 -T|--input    FILENAME (or - for STDIN):  List with sizes and paths, try:

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

               are rounded up to 2048 blocks plus estimated overhead for
               filenames (see -o option)
  2: like 1, but all files in directory are put together (as "atom") onto the
               same medium. This does not apply to subdirectories, however.
  3: like 2, but don't coalesc files when the size of the "atom" becomes too
               large for the medium size (currently 4488M)
  4: like 2, but the max. size of the atoms is limited to 4488M (storing the
               rest on another medium)

 -F|--follow   Follow symlinks. Use with care!
 -b|--blksize  NUMBER, block size of the target filesystem (currently 2048).
 -o|--overhead NUMBER, overhead caused by directory entries (as factor for the
               filename length, default: 50, empiricaly found for Joliet+RR
               with not-so-deep directory structure). Works in exploration
               mode.
 -a|--accuracy NUMBER (1=faster, large number=better efficiency, default: 500)
 -S|--simple   Simple/stupid/alphabetic mode
 -T|--input    FILENAME (or - for STDIN):  List with sizes and paths, try:

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...).

File sizes are expected to be in bytes, append modifier letters to multiply
with a factor, eg 200M (b,k,K,m,M,g,G for Bytes, Kb, KiB, Mb, MiB, Gb, GiB).
The default output mode is creating file catalogs useable with
    mkisofs -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points -path-list CATALOG

Examples:
dirsplit -m -s 120M -e4 largedirwithdata/ -p /zipmedia/backup_   #move stuff into splitted backup dirs
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 music/ # make mkisofs catalogs to burn all music to 700M CDRs, keep single files in each dir together
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '/other\/Soundtracks/' music/ # like above, only take files from other/Soundtracks
dirsplit -s 700M -e2 -f '!/Thumbs.db|Desktop.ini|\.m3u$/i' # like above, ignore some junk files and playlists, both letter cases

Bugs: overhead trough blocksize alignment and directory entry storage varies,
heavily depends on the target filesystem and configuration (see -b and -o).

You should compare the required size of the created catalogs, eg.:
for x in *list ; do mkisofs -quiet -D -r --joliet-long -graft-points \
 -path-list $x -print-size; done
(output in blocks of 2048 bytes) with the expected size (-s) and media data
(cdrecord -v -toc ...). 

dirsplit [options] [advanced options] < directory >
